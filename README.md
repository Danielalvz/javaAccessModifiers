**IDE required to Run the project**

To run the Java code, you need to open this file in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Intellij Idea, Eclipse, or Netbeans.

**Introduction**

This repository contains some classes, parent and child classes that inherit from the parent class. With different access modifiers, the goal is to practice this topic of modifiers and how to access variables and methods.
